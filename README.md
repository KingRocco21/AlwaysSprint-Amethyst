## Why should I install this mod if I can just add W to Sprint in the `options.txt`?
W is removed from Sprint every time you rebind a control. With this mod, the sprint keybind is hidden, so there are no key conflicts.

# Usage Guide
1. Install [Amethyst](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher)
2. Open the Mod Manager in Amethyst Launcher, and click `Open Mods Folder`
3. Download the latest [AlwaysSprint release](https://github.com/KingRocco21/AlwaysSprint-Amethyst/releases) and the required AmethystRuntime
4. Add AmethystRuntime and AlwaysSprint to the mods folder
5. Extract them, and check for duplicate folders inside each mod. If you see duplicate folder names, move the contents out of the duplicate.
6. Close and reopen Amethyst Launcher, open the `Profile Editor`, and create or edit a profile with AmethystRuntime and AlwaysSprint-Amethyst enabled
7. Launch the game, and sprint should be toggled on by default.
